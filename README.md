# SQL Project - Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset 

### :smiley:

Using a **large dataset and dataset ER diagram** from Yelp, which provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations â€“ businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.


The project has two parts.


`In the first part`, there are a series of questions regarding the data to help profile and better understand the data.


`In the second part`, I came up with several particular research question for analysis, my own **inferences and analysis of the data** for the questions, and **prepared the dataset for the analysis**. 


_Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon._
