# SQL-Project
This project is `Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset`.


Using a dataset from a US-based organization called Yelp, which provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations â€“ businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.


The project has two parts.


In the first part, there are a series of questions regarding the data to help you profile and better understand the data.


In the second part, I come up with my own question for analysis, my own own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer, and prepare the dataset for the analysis that I choose to do. 


Feel free to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy, paste, and test code.
