# SQL-Project
This project is `Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset`.


Using a **large dataset and dataset ER diagram** from a US-based organization called Yelp, which provides **a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations â€“ businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc.** Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.


The project has two parts.


`In the first part`, there are a series of questions regarding the data to help profile and better understand the data.


`In the second part`, I **came up with several particular research question for analysis**, my own **inferences and analysis of the data** for the questions, and **prepared the dataset for the analysis**. 


_Feel free to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to test code._
